    <h2>Why I want to take IS 413:</h2>
    <p>I want to learn how to better work with strongly typed languages. I am excited to increase my capacity and experience with Object Oriented Programming. I have been able to do decently well in the other programming classes but I still feel I haven't totally grasped everything I need with OOP. I am particularly excited for this class now because at the recent career fair I got an interview with FAST Enterprises who said we'd be working with .NET for the summer internship, if I were accepted. Finally, I want to really work hard and be able to over-contribute in my group. </p>

    <h2>3 things I'd be interested in doing after I graduate'</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Management Consulting</li>
        <li>Working as a Business Analyst/Product Manager</li>
        <li>Working into the management of a mid-sized company</li>
    </ol>
